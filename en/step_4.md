## Step 3

```python
circle_radius = ##

pos_1 = (0, 0) 
col_1 = (255, 255, 0) #Note to Max, this would be the colour that they had chosen in the previousl step

pos_2 = (#, #, #) #Note to Max, here they have three slots to choose positions and colours, that they type in.
col_2 = (#, #, #)
```
Choose a position and colour for the second circle. Type numbers for the `x` and `y` coordinates, and choosing values between `0` andd `255` for the red, green and blue colour in the spaces provided.
