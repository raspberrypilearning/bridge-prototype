## Step 4

```python
circle_radius = ##

pos_1 = (0, 0) 
col_1 = (255, 255, 0) #Note to Max, this would be the colour that they had chosen in the previousl step

pos_2 = (#, #, #) #Note to Max, here they have three slots to choose positions and colours, that they type in.
col_2 = (#, #, #)
```

Next you can add a second button. Its position will be stored in `pos_2` and its colour in `pos_2`.

Type numbers for the `x` and `y` coordinates on line 6. 

Choose values between `0` and `255` for the red, green and blue colour on line 7.
