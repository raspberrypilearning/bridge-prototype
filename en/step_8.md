## Step 3

```python
circle_radius = ##

pos_1 = (0, 0) 
col_1 = (255, 255, 0)

pos_2 = (#, #, #)
col_2 = (#, #, #)

pos_3 = ()
pos_3 = ()

# HERE WOULD BE THE OTHER VARIABLE THEY HAVE SET

my_image = ""


```

Look at the images below, and choose one that will be used for the variable `my_image`, to set the background.

**NOTE TO MAX - possibly give images for them to choose with the filename below, or if there is not enough space, just give them the filenames. It might be useful to have a mixture of jpeg, jpg, png, svg and webp images, so they can get used to file exxtensions**
