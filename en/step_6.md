## Step 6

```python
circle_radius = ##

pos_1 = (0, 0) 
col_1 = (255, 255, 0)

pos_2 = (#, #, #)
col_2 = (#, #, #)

pos_3 = ()
col_3 = ()

#NOTE TO MAX - Free text for them here, to add the variables that they want.
```

Add a fourth button. Create a variable `pos_4` to store it's position, and a variable `col_4` to store a colour.

Use the other variables as examples to help you.
