## Step 2

```python
pos_1 = (0, 0) #Note to Max, this would be the position that they had chosen in the previousl step
col_1 = (0, 0, 0)
```

You can change the colour of the button. The `col_1` variable stores the colour.

Colours are set using three numbers. The first number sets the amount of red, the second the amount of green, and the third the amount of blue. This is called the **RGB** system.

The numbers can be anything between `0` and `255`

Select the colour you would like to use for your first button and then click **Run code**.

```python
(255, 0, 0)
```
```python
(0, 255, 0)
```
```python
(0, 0, 255)
```
```python
(255, 255, 0)
```
