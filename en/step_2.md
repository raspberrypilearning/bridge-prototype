## Step 2

```python
pos_1 = (0, 0) #Note to Max, this would be the position that they had chosen in the previousl step
col_1 = (0, 0, 0)
```

You can change the colour of the circle as well. The `col_1` variable stores the values of three numbers.

The first number is for the amount of red, the second for the amount of green, and the third the amount of blue. The numbers can be anything between `0` and `255` **NOTE TO MAX - these are the values to be chosen for the `col_1` variable** 

```python
(255, 0, 0)
```
```python
(0,255, 0)
```
```python
(0, 0, 255)
```
```python
(255, 255, 0)
```
