## Step 8

```python
circle_radius = ##

pos_1 = (0, 0) 
col_1 = (255, 255, 0)

pos_2 = (#, #, #)
col_2 = (#, #, #)

pos_3 = ()
col_3 = ()

# HERE WOULD BE THE OTHER VARIABLE THEY HAVE SET

my_image = ""


```
Now choose an image to paint. 

The variable `my_image` will store the filename of the image you choose. 

Select a file name from the options below. You won't see the image yet, you will display it in the next step.
