## Step 7

```python
circle_radius = ##

pos_1 = (0, 0) 
col_1 = (255, 255, 0)

pos_2 = (#, #, #)
col_2 = (#, #, #)

pos_3 = ()
pos_3 = ()

#NOTE TO MAX - Free text for them here, to add the variables that they want.
```

You can add as many more variables as you like. Choose names for the variables such as `pos_4` and `col_4`, and give them coordinates and values. Try to make the circles line up with each other.
