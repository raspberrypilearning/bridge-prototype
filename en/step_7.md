## Step 8

```python
circle_radius = ##

pos_1 = (0, 0) 
col_1 = (255, 255, 0)

pos_2 = (#, #, #)
col_2 = (#, #, #)

pos_3 = ()
col_3 = ()

# HERE WOULD BE THE OTHER VARIABLE THEY HAVE SET

my_image = ""


```
You have been provided with an image to paint over, but you need to decide its size and position.

A function called `setup()` is used to set the background image. The first two numbers set the position of the image, and the second two numbers set the size of the image.

Experiment with the position and size of the image, so that it looks correct on your screen.
