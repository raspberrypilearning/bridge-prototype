## Step 9

```python
circle_radius = ##

pos_1 = (0, 0) 
col_1 = (255, 255, 0)

pos_2 = (#, #, #)
col_2 = (#, #, #)

pos_3 = ()
pos_3 = ()

# HERE WOULD BE THE OTHER VARIABLE THEY HAVE SET

my_image = "cat.jpg"

def draw():
    
```

`def draw():` is a function. This is a small package of code that will be used to draw the background.

Inside the `draw()` function, you can add code to place your bacground and choose it's size. Choose the best one for your screen.

**NOTE TO MAX - These would be a variety of sizes and positions that could be suitable for different display resolutions.**
```python
add_background(100, 100, 250, 300)
```
```python
add_background(100, 100, 250, 300)
```
```python
add_background(100, 100, 250, 300)
```
```python
add_background(100, 100, 250, 300)
