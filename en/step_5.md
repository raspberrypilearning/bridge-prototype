## Step 5

```python
circle_radius = ##

pos_1 = (0, 0) 
col_1 = (255, 255, 0)

pos_2 = (#, #, #)
col_2 = (#, #, #)

pos_3 = () #NOTE TO MAX, they have to type in numbers and the commas for this one.
col_3 = ()
```
Next add a third button, creating a new position (`pos_3`) and colour (`col_3`) for it.

Don't forget that a position needs two numbers, seperated by a comma `,` and a colour needs three numbers seperated by a comma `,`. Both sets of numbers need to be surrounded by brackets `()`.

Use the first two buttons as examples to help you write your code.
