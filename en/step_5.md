## Step 3

```python
circle_radius = ##

pos_1 = (0, 0) 
col_1 = (255, 255, 0)

pos_2 = (#, #, #)
col_2 = (#, #, #)

pos_3 = () #NOTE TO MAX, they have to type in numbers and the commas for this one.
pos_3 = ()
```

Choose a position and colour for a third circle. Don't forget that a position needs two numbers, seperated by a comma `,` and a colour needs three numbers seperated by a comma `,`.
