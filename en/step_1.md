## Step 1

```python
pos_1 = (0, 0)
col_1 = (0, 0, 0)
```

Run the following code, and you should see a small black circle, in the top left corner of the output pain.

You can change the position of the circle by changing the x (horizontal) and y (verticle) coordinates stored in the `pos_1` variable

Choose a position to place you circle: **NOTE TO MAX - these are the choices that the user can place**

```python
(20,20)
```
```python
(400,20)
```
```python
(20,150)
```
```python
(400,150)
```
