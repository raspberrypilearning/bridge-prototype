## Step 1

```python
pos_1 = (0, 0)
col_1 = (0, 0, 0)
```

You're going to build a painting app!

Start by making a palette full of colourful buttons, just like the paint artists use.

We need to tell the computer where to put the first button on the screen. Think of the screen like a big grid, with numbers going across (left to right) and numbers going down (top to bottom). These numbers are called `x` and `y` coordinates.

The `pos_1` variable stores these `x` and `y` coordinates. Click on one of the choices and then click "Run code" to see it appear. Change the numbers until you are happy.

```python
(20,20)
```
```python
(400,20)
```
```python
(20,150)
```
```python
(400,150)
```
